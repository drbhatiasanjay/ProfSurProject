## What We Did

### 1. Studied the Thesis Document

**File:** `DETERMINANTS OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE OVER CORPORATE LIFE STAGES.docx`

- PhD thesis by **Surendra Kumar**, University of Delhi (2025)
- Supervised by Dr. Varun Dawar & Dr. Chandra Prakash Gupta
- Topic: How capital structure determinants (profitability, tangibility, tax, size, etc.) vary across corporate life stages (Startup → Growth → Maturity → Decline) for Indian firms
- Methods: Panel data — Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, System GMM
- Theories: Pecking Order, Trade-off, Agency Cost, Signalling, M&M, Free Cash Flow

### 2. Explored the Dataset

**File:** `sp401nf24y_furtherEd_oldCLS.dta` (Stata format)

- **8,677 rows** x **159 columns**
- **401 companies** (S&P BSE/NSE listed Indian corporates)
- **24 years** of panel data (2001–2024)
- **103 industry groups**

**Key variables identified:**

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `leverage` | Debt ratio (dependent var) | Mean 21%, median 15.8%, outliers up to 1425% |
| `prof` | Profitability | <1% missing |
| `tang` | Asset tangibility | <1% missing |
| `tax` | Tax rate | <1% missing |
| `dvnd` | Dividend payout | 9% missing |
| `size` | Firm size (total assets) | <1% missing |
| `taxShield` | Non-debt tax shield | <1% missing |
| `pmShare` | Promoter shareholding | 15.7% missing |
| `corplifestage` | 8 life stages | Startup, Growth, Maturity, Shakeout1/2/3, Decline, Decay |
| `GFC` | Global Financial Crisis dummy | — |
| `ibc2016` | Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code dummy | — |
| `dcovid20less` | COVID-19 dummy | — |

**Life stage distribution:**

| Stage | Count | Avg Leverage (%) |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Maturity | 4,491 | 17.2 |
| Growth | 1,933 | 28.2 |
| Shakeout3 | 947 | 14.1 |
| Startup | 580 | 32.8 |
| Shakeout2 | 353 | 23.4 |
| Decay | 176 | 20.1 |
| Decline | 156 | 38.3 |
| Shakeout1 | 41 | 13.0 |

**Data quality:** ~40+ columns with >50% missing (mostly pledged shares, granular ownership). Core financials are clean (<1% missing).

### 3. Created SQLite Database

**Script:** `load_to_db.py`
**Database:** `capital_structure.db` (4.8 MB)

Normalized the flat 159-column Stata file into 5 relational tables:

| Table | Rows | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| `companies` | 401 | Company info, NSE symbol, industry, incorporation year |
| `life_stages` | 8 | Life stage code → name mapping |
| `financials` | 8,677 | Leverage, profitability, tangibility, tax, size, cash flows, event dummies |
| `ownership` | 8,677 | Promoter/non-promoter shareholding patterns |
| `market_index` | 24 | Yearly S&P BSE index data (PE, PB, returns, beta) |

**3 pre-built views:**
- `v_company_financials` — joined company + financials + life stage (dashboard-ready)
- `v_life_stage_summary` — metrics aggregated by life stage and year
- `v_industry_summary` — metrics aggregated by industry and year

**6 indexes** for fast querying on company, year, life stage, and composites.

### 4. Saved to Obsidian

## Next Steps

- [ ] Build a dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI / web app)
- [ ] Replicate thesis regressions (FE, RE, System GMM)
- [ ] Winsorize leverage outliers (1st/99th percentile)
- [ ] Visualize leverage trends across life stages over time
- [ ] Ownership structure deep-dive
